                Sensors are placed at the entrance of the location in order to to register the number of people going in and out
                of the location.
                <br>
                This provides real-time information about how many people there are in the location at a given time.

                The screen tells visitors whether it's enough space for them inside.
                The screen is either green or red letting the visitor know that it's safe for them to go inside.
                It also tells the visitor how many there are currently inside, and the total capacity for the location.

              When opening the app, this is the first page you will see.

                When searching for a place, the app will tell you if there are similar places nearby,
                making it easier choosing a related, less crowded location.
                The search results forms a list with the total capacity for the locations,
