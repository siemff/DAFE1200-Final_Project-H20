          <h2 class="problem-text">The challenge of a global pandemic</h2>

          <p class="problem-text"> HowCrowded is working towards handling one
            of the challenges that comes with the COVID-19
            pandemic:<br>
            <i>- Managing to keep distance to other people, in
              order to prevent the virus to spread.</i><br>
              Today’s global pandemic has taught us many things.
              For instance, it's made us more aware to wash our hands, and perhaps
              most importantly, it's learned us the importance of practicing social distancing.
              WHO states that to keep yourself and others
              safe from COVID-19, it’s important to keep a distance
              of at least one meter from others, and an even greater
              distance indoors; the further away, the better <a href="resources.html"><b>(reference 3).</b></a>
              However, in some situations, it's hard maintaining
              distance to other people. Doing necessary chores, such
              as going to the grocery store, can make it difficult to keep
              distance to the other shoppers if the store is crowded. This is also a big challenge for
              other indoor spaces that are open to the public. They need
              regulations to ensure that there are not too many people
              inside the area at the same time: be it a library, grocery
              store, or a gym.</p><br>

              <h2 class="problem-text">The challenge illustrated</h2>
              <p class="problem-text">These days many stores and other public spaces have a display
                of how many people are allowed into the store, occasionally
                accompanied by member of staff that checks the numbers.
                However, this is often only displayed by a simple note outside.
                For example for bigger grocery stores where the number might be
                up to 50 people it is difficult to see how many people are actually
                in the store. This put both the customer and the organization’s
                staff at risk of having too many people inside the same space
                at the same time.</p>
