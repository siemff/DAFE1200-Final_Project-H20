        <h2>A dual solution</h2>
        <p>HowCrowded provides a dual solution to make it easier
          for both people and organizations to practice social distancing.<br><br>
          This is achieved by:
          <ul>
            <li>Sensors provided for indoor locations accessible by
              the public, such as grocery stores, libraries or gyms.</li>
              <li>An app/website where the public can check
                in real time how many people there are in an indoor location at a given time,
                including general trends, so they can plan their visit
                based on how crowded it is at specific times.</li>
                <li>Technology that can be used by organizations and businesses
                  to manage information about how many people there are in their
                  area at a given time. This can be used by the business for planning,
                  as well as using the technology at the front door monitoring the number of people inside,
                  preventing the area from becoming crowded.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>

                <p class="solution-heading">Consumer</p>
                <p class="solution-text-white"> This will make it much easier for people to plan their trips to public
                  indoor spaces as they can both check in real-time how many people there are and
                  see how many people usually visit at given times.</p>

                  <p class="solution-text-white"> For organizations and businesses, they no longer have to manually count
                      how many people there are inside the location at all times. For many businesses this will mean
                    that they no longer have to use staff monitoring by the door, as the customer is told by the screen when
                    it's room enough for them to go inside. </p>

                  <h2>Differentiating us from competitors</h2>
                  <p>There are concepts similar to our service.
                    Google, for instance has a function which shows how busy a place
                    is, and also shows predictions for different times of the day.
                    Using sensors to track people going in and out of a building
                    is also a technology that already exists, though it's not used much.
                    However, the idea behind our service, is combining these two technologies.
                    The stores will become better at managing the flow of customers, and the customers will get an accurate
                    number of how many people there are in the store at a given time -
                    making it easier for them to plan when to safely go to the store.</p>
